YesShare! v2 — Improved demo
What's new:
- Auth: modal forms for login & registration (no prompt())
- Two-step page creation: content -> choose slug -> publish
- Stronger slug validation: only ascii (no ékezet), allowed special set: - _ ( ) ! + ? : %
- Search behavior: in-app search bar treats inputs ending with .yes as potential URLs; if slug invalid or not found, falls back to text search.
- Profile and pages updated after publish.

Files:
- index.html
- style.css
- app.js
